However, many of these habitats are threatened by a number of stressors, including rising sea levels and increasing urbanization. Restoration and preservation of affected juvenile habitats can help support adult populations.\nThe Robinson Preserve Sport Fish Tagging Project was initiated to determine the extent to which the habitat restoration at Robinson Preserve, a 682-acre area with a variety of restored fisheries nursery habitat, contributes juvenile sport fish to adult populations in the greater Tampa Bay area. The contribution of juveniles is a major information gap that exists for many habitat restoration projects, despite being a realistic metric for evaluating restoration success. With the help of Manatee County Department of Parks and Natural Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Habitat Conservation, researchers at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute are seeking to fill this information gap by tagging and tracking the movement of juvenile sport fishes from and within Robinson Preserve."

    "text": "Acoustic telemetry works through a series of tags and receivers. Tags embedded in fish send ‘pings’ that are detected by receivers spaced across the area of interest (Jim Whittington, FWRI).\n\n\nWhen researchers design acoustic telemetry studies, careful consideration and planning must occur to ensure that receivers are strategically located to detect fish in all areas of interest. Acoustic tags continue to ping until no battery power remains, so there is potential for animals to move great distances from their initial tagging location before the tag dies. The acoustic tag will remain in the fish for its entire life, but we will no longer receive location information once the battery is too weak to transmit. Acoustic telemetry networks allow researchers to collaborate and communicate detections of other researchers’ tags as they download their telemetry data. These telemetry networks, such as iTAG (Integrated Tracking of Animals in the Gulf of Mexico), essentially integrate the acoustic arrays of all users, which may allow for tag detections significant distances away from where the animal was first tagged, increasing our knowledge base.\n\n\n\nAcoustic receiver and water quality logger before being deployed in shallow water environment adjacent to Robinson Preserve."

    "text": "An acoustic tag to be\nimplanted in a fish.\n\n\nIn spring (April/May) and fall (Oct/Nov) of 2022 and 2023, we will implant sport fish with acoustic tags. The goal is to tag up to 40 fish in 2022 and another 40 in 2023. These tags can last up to two years, so we will be listening for these fish through 2024. While monitoring these fishes, we will look for the number of ‘pings’ within the various waterbodies to see how fish are using the different waterbodies and nursery habitats, as well as ‘pings’ outside the preserve, which indicates functionality of the nursery habitats as fish have emigrated from the nursery habitat to the adult habitats in Tampa Bay and nearby waters.\nFishes sampled for tagging will be directly targeted and caught using a 9.1-m seine net. The net is deployed in a circular pattern to capture groups of sportfish in areas where they are observed or expected. This direct targeting of sportfish reduces the incidence of bycatch and maximizes the probability of catching appropriately-sized sport fish.\n\n\n\nA 9.1-m center bag seine used to encircle and capture targeted groups of sport fish."

    "text": "Hydrological restoration allowed coastal wetland vegetation communities to become reestablished. Robinson Preserve now contains a variety of estuarine habitats, including mangrove-lined creeks and salt marshes, that are critical nursery habitats for many sport fish species. The structure of these vegetation communities protects young fish from predators and provides high prey availability. Young-of-the-year (recently hatched and recruited fish) and juvenile Common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis), Red Drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Spotted Seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), and Atlantic Tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) have all been observed in Robinson Preserve.\nIn 2021, an expansion of Robinson Preserve created multiple waterbodies with unique characteristics such as variation in depth and tidal connections, that may affect their performance as nursery habitat for sport fish. These waterbodies were ultimately connected with the Tampa Bay estuary with the intent to provide fisheries nursery habitat, but for a nursery habitat to be truly functional, sub-adult fish must move away (or emigrate) from juvenile to sub-adult and adult habitats.\nThe main goal of this study is to determine if the restored habitats are providing sub-adult fish to the Tampa Bay fishery. To do this, we will use acoustic telemetry to track fish. Sport fish within Robinson Preserve will be implanted with an acoustic (sound) transmitter and we will set up listening stations (i.e., receivers) in and around the preserve to record when tagged fish swim by. If waterbodies within Robinson Preserve are acting as nursery habitats and supplying fish to the sub-adult and adult population, we should eventually detect acoustically tagged fish with receivers located outside the preserve boundary. We can also use telemetry data to examine how juvenile sportfish use different waterbodies within the preserve, determine which corridors are most effective for emigration, and look for differences in habitat use among species. The information obtained from this study will be useful for future restoration design and construction."

    "text": "On August 23-24, FWRI staff recovered data from 11 acoustic receivers and 4 water loggers within and adjacent to Robinson Preserve. Our acoustic receivers revealed over 300,000 detections, including detections from all 22 fish that were tagged in April 2022. Preliminary analyses showed that several of our tagged fish potentially exited the preserve at some point during the four months since the initial tagging occurred."
