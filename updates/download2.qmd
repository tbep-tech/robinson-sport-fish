On December 5th, FWRI staff recovered data from 11 acoustic receivers and 4 water loggers within and adjacent to Robinson Preserve. Our acoustic receivers revealed almost an additional 300,000 detections, including detections from 18 of the 26 fish that have been tagged since April 2022. Several fish continue to be detected on receivers located outside of the preserve.

Staff also deployed 2 additional acoustic receivers to replace receiver arrays that were unrecoverable.
