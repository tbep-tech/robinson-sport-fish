On May 18th, FWRI staff recovered data from 12 acoustic receivers and 3 water loggers within and adjacent to Robinson Preserve. Our acoustic receivers revealed an additional 232,000 detections, including detections from 18 of the 44 fish that have been tagged since April 2022. Several fish continue to be detected on receivers located outside of the preserve.
