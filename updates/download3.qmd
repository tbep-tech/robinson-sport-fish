On February 21st and 22nd, FWRI staff recovered data from 11 acoustic receivers and 4 water loggers within and adjacent to Robinson Preserve. Our acoustic receivers revealed an additional 200,000 detections, including detections from 18 of the 27 fish that have been tagged since April 2022. Several fish continue to be detected on receivers located outside of the preserve.

One acoustic array was unrecoverable, while a second receiver was found by an eagle-eyed civilian and returned to FWRI staff.
