title: "Importance of Tagging"

Studying animal movement is important for researchers
because it gives us insight into the habitats animals use for different
purposes, which can help determine their biological requirements and the
ecological factors that contribute to their persistence. Unfortunately, visual
observation of animals in aquatic environments can be quite difficult,
especially for extended periods of time. Acoustic telemetry is a tool used by
researchers to monitor the movements of animals in aquatic environments, often over
vast areas for several years. Acoustic telemetry gives researchers a window
into an otherwise unknown world. It allows researchers to observe individual
fish as they move through their environment and use habitats throughout their
life cycle, which can help resource managers make management decisions and
implement science-based conservation initiatives.
