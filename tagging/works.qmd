title: "How Acoustic Tagging Works"
---

For studies focused on fish movement, acoustic tags (or
transmitters) are typically surgically implanted into the abdomen of the fish. The
size of the tag varies depending on the species of interest to avoid altering
the animal's behavior and ensure survivorship. Once implanted, the acoustic
tags emit short pulses of sound that communicate a unique identifier at preset
intervals. These 'pings' are detected by a nearby hydrophone, or acoustic
receiver, that stores the detection data so it can be downloaded and analyzed
by the researcher.

When researchers design acoustic telemetry studies, careful
consideration and planning must occur to ensure that receivers are
strategically located to detect fish in all areas of interest. Acoustic tags
continue to ping until no battery power remains, so there is potential for
animals to move great distances from their initial tagging location before the
tag dies. The acoustic tag will remain in the fish for its entire life, but we
will no longer receive location information once the battery is too weak to
transmit. Acoustic telemetry networks allow researchers to collaborate and communicate
detections of other researchers' tags as they download their telemetry data.
These telemetry networks, such as iTAG (Integrated Tracking of Animals in the
Gulf of Mexico), essentially integrate the acoustic arrays of all users, which
may allow for tag detections significant distances away from where the animal
was first tagged, increasing our knowledge base.
